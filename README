  Todo
  
 - Remove the gwt stylename from the caption
 - Simplify the DOM tree for the caption component
 - More ease-out algorithms
 - Use only one Animation class for both open/close and drawer replacement


  Known issues
  
 - IE8 (hardly surprisingly) does not calculate the drawer content's size correctly
 
 
  Ideas for future features
  
 - Notifying the opening or closing the container (e.g. for lazy components)


  Changelog
 
1.1
 - Moved the component's theme into the widgetset, so that that you don't need to modify your theme at all
 - Added the use of variables also from the server to the client
 - Fixed a bug where a width calculation was based on height.
